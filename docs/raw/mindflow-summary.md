# MindFlow: Executive Summary & Technology Decision Matrix

## 🎯 What You're Building

**MindFlow** is an AI-first task manager where you primarily **talk to GPT** instead of clicking forms. Natural conversation replaces rigid UIs.

### Core Loop
1. **You**: "Add blog post about FastAPI, due Friday, high priority"
2. **GPT**: Understands intent, extracts "blog post", "Friday", "high priority"
3. **Function Calling**: GPT calls `create_task()` with structured data
4. **Backend**: FastAPI validates and saves to PostgreSQL
5. **You**: "What should I do next?"
6. **Relevance Engine**: Analyzes all tasks, returns optimal one with reasoning

### Why This Matters for You
- **Zero clicks**: Everything via conversation (what your brain naturally wants)
- **Context awareness**: AI learns your patterns (deadline focus? quick tasks? impact-driven?)
- **Explainable decisions**: "Do X because deadline is today + high priority + quick win"
- **Podcast-ready**: Being able to naturally discuss "what's on my plate" is confidence-building

## 📊 Technology Decision Matrix

| Decision | Option A | Option B | Option C | **CHOSEN** |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **AI Interface** | Chat Completions API | Assistants API | Responses API | **Chat Completions** |
| Reason | Full control, cheaper, faster iteration | Easier state mgmt but limited | Newer, but less proven | ✓ Best control |
| **Backend** | FastAPI | Django | Flask | **FastAPI** |
| Reason | Modern, async, type-safe | Heavier, but full-featured | Too minimal | ✓ Perfect fit |
| **Frontend** | React | Vue | **Lit 3 + Web Components** | **Lit 3** |
| Reason | Largest ecosystem | Good balance | Minimal bundle, native | ✓ Matches your stack |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Firebase | **PostgreSQL** |
| Reason | Relational data, JSONB flexibility | Less structure | Lock-in | ✓ Best for tasks |
| **Hosting** | Fly.io | Render | Vercel | **Fly.io** |
| Reason | Developer-friendly, container-native | Similar | Frontend-only | ✓ Suits Docker workflow |

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Explained

### Why Chat Completions (Not Assistants API)?

**Chat Completions + Function Calling** (Your choice):
```
User: "Add blog post due Friday"
  ↓
GPT analyzes with functions available
  ↓
GPT returns: "Call create_task with args: {title: ..., due_at: ...}"
  ↓
YOUR CODE executes the function and returns result
  ↓
GPT generates friendly response
```

**Assistants API** (Alternative):
- GPT stores conversation on OpenAI's servers (thread management)
- Fewer function calls but less control
- Better for long-running assistants with memory
- Worse for testing and iteration

**Why Chat Completions wins for MVP:**
- You control the entire flow (easier debugging)
- Cheaper per request
- Faster iteration (change system prompt → deploy)
- Better for learning what works

### Why FastAPI (Not Django)?

| Factor | FastAPI | Django |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Setup time | 5 min | 30 min |
| Async support | Native | Bolted-on |
| Type hints | First-class | Afterthought |
| OpenAPI docs | Auto-generated | Need setup |
| Performance | ⚡ Very fast | Good |
| Learning curve | Gentle | Steep |
| Right-sizing | Perfect for this | Overkill |

FastAPI is literally designed for what you're building: API-first, async, integrated with AI APIs.

### Why Lit 3 (Not React)?

You said **"ultramodern"** and **"inspired by Vite + Bun"**. Lit fits perfectly:

| Factor | Lit 3 | React |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Bundle size | 5KB | 42KB |
| Build tool | Vite native | Requires config |
| Web Components | Native | No |
| TypeScript | Full support | Full support |
| Performance | Excellent | Excellent |
| Ecosystem | Growing | Massive |
| Learning curve | Easy | Medium |

**Lit is literally designed for your use case:**
- Web components (can reuse in any framework later)
- Minimal JavaScript (chat UI doesn't need complexity)
- Fast dev loop with Vite
- Lightweight for production

## 📈 MVP vs Full Product

### MVP (3 weeks, Week 1-3)

**What ships:**
```
✅ Chat interface: "Add task: X, due Y"
✅ Task creation via natural language
✅ List tasks sorted by relevance
✅ "What should I do next?" recommendation
✅ Basic dashboard view
❌ No auth (test user only)
❌ No habits/learning
❌ No calendar sync
```

**Tech required:**
- FastAPI backend (100 lines)
- PostgreSQL (5 tables)
- Lit chat component (200 lines)
- OpenAI integration (150 lines)
- Total: ~500 lines of code

**Why so small?** Because Chat Completions does heavy lifting:
- GPT understands "due Friday" → converts to datetime
- GPT recognizes intent (create vs update vs list)
- GPT handles ambiguity ("high priority" → priority 8)
- You just validate and store

### Full Product (3-6 months)

**Additional features:**
- Authentication + multi-user
- Habit learning (AI learns your patterns)
- Calendar integration (Google Calendar context)
- Email/Slack interface
- Team collaboration
- Advanced NLU (entity extraction)
- Export to Todoist/Google Tasks
- Analytics dashboard

## 🛠️ Using Claude Code for Implementation

### Phase 1: Backend Setup (Prompt)

```
I'm building MindFlow, an AI task manager. Use FastAPI + PostgreSQL + OpenAI.

Create:
1. FastAPI app with async database connection to Supabase PostgreSQL
2. SQLAlchemy models for tasks, users, conversation_logs
3. Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
4. OpenAI Chat Completions integration with function calling
5. Task CRUD services with relevance scoring
6. /api/chat endpoint that processes natural language

Use async/await throughout. Add type hints. Include error handling.
Reference: mindflow-spec.txt for schema details.
```

### Phase 2: Frontend (Prompt)

```
Build a Lit 3 chat interface for MindFlow using:
- Lit 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Vite for build tooling
- Chat bubble component for messages
- Input field with send button
- API integration with /api/chat endpoint
- Loading states and error handling

Make it look modern, responsive, and minimal bundle size.
```

### Phase 3: Deployment (Prompt)

```
Create Docker setup for MindFlow with:
- Docker Compose for local development (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Lit dev server)
- Dockerfile for production backend
- Dockerfile for production frontend
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD to Fly.io
- Environment variable setup for secrets

Include database migrations with Alembic.
